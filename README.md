> ðŸ‘‘ Because "password123" ainâ€™t it, chief.

This is a simple yet powerful Python tool that checks how strong your passwords really are.  
It analyzes the length, complexity, and whether itâ€™s a commonly used password, and gives you a strength rating, along with tips to improve it.
[note: the list of common passwords may not be 100% accurate but we use RockYou so it's pretty reliable.]

Built for real-world use, not just coding practice.
